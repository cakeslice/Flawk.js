## ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is a **work in progress** and is missing important documentation

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Keep in mind that Flawk is not suitable for beginners
- You need to be comfortable with **TypeScript**, **React** and **Express/Mongoose** to use this boilerplate

&nbsp;

The Frontend and Backend can be used in isolation but to get the most out of this project you should use it for **full-stack** development
